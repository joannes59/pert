# pert
Project Retro planning.

To do this, it is ideal to use the PERT diagram (Program Evaluation and Review Technique). It is a visual tool for project scheduling and planning

Its objective is to organize tasks in the form of a network to visualize connections between different stages, execution time, and interdependencies.

The PERT diagram provides a comprehensive method for defining dependencies and identifying the longest steps that determine the maximum project duration (critical path). It enables the preparation of the Gantt chart.
